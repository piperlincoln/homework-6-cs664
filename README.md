# Background
I have been teaching myself to crochet for the past several months in order to achieve my 
dream of opening an Etsy shop and selling custom stuffed animals based on the unique interests 
of my customers. Therefore, the purpose of my Natlang application is to scan messages I will 
eventually receive from my customers and determine the appropriate response. That could entail 
encouraging them to share their interests to secure a potential sale, thanking them for positive 
feedback, or salvaging a relationship after a disappointing final product.

# Instructions

To run the NatLang application, execute the following command in the same folder as the file in this repository.

```
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

# Future Enhancements
1. Handle Multiple Sentiments per Message
2. Increase Sophistication of Error Handling
